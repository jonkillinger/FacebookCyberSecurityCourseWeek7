1. (Required) Vulnerability Name or ID
  - [ ] Summary: It is possible to enumerate through author archives of wordpress. This can be performed automatically by the wpscan utility, but underneath involves sending requests to the site with different id values. Possible fixes involve firewall implementations and / or modifying the htaccess file with code like:
  ```
  # Block User ID Phishing Requests
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^author=([0-9]*) [NC]
	RewriteRule .* http://example.com/? [L,R=302]
</IfModule>
```
